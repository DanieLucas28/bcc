# Introduction

`qcc` is a package for **statistical process control and control charts** built based on the `qcc` package, with new functions allowing the use of beta control charts.

This package allows the user to:

- build beta control charts

As the package uses the `qcc` package as the basis for building the graphics, all `qcc` functions and utilities also work on `bcc`. For more informations please consider visiting https://luca-scr.github.io/qcc/.

#Application

You can use `bcc` in two basic ways:

- discrete data representing the sample size using `type = 1`;

- continuous data without sample size with values in the range between [0.1] using `type = 2`; you can make a ratio between the data to be analyzed for example.


#Beta Charts

## Beta Chart for discrete data

```{r}
data("Montgomery2005")
bcc(data = Montgomery2005$`Peças defeituosas`, sizes=Montgomery2005$`Tamanho da amostra`, type = "1")
```

##Beta chart for continuos data

```{r}
data("Drapper1998data")
bcc(data = Drapper1998data, type = "2")
```
